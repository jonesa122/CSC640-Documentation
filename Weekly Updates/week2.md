# Week Two: Milestones in Software Development  
## Date: October 23rd

# 📆 Milestones = Planning for Progress 
Milestones are key checkpoints in a project that help you track progress and stay aligned. They break large goals into manageable pieces and give structure to your workflow.

Why milestones matter:

- They define what needs to be done and by when  
- They help identify delays early  
- They make steady progress visible  
- They reduce last-minute stress

Even though the final deadline might be weeks away, setting earlier planned milestones helps you stay on track and avoid surprises.

# 🔁 Development Models: Waterfall → Spiral → Agile  
Software development models have evolved in response to the growing complexity of projects and the need for flexibility:

## **Waterfall**  
- ✅ Clear documentation and planning  
- ❌ Inflexible to change; problems often discovered too late  
- 🔄 **Limitation**: Once a phase is complete, it’s hard to go back — making it risky for dynamic projects

---
# 🔁 Development Models: Waterfall → Spiral → Agile  

## **Spiral**  
- ✅ Better at managing uncertainty  
- ❌ Complex and resource-intensive  
- 🔄 **Evolution**: Recognized the need for revisiting earlier decisions and adapting as new information emerged

---
# 🔁 Development Models: Waterfall → Spiral → Agile  

## **Agile**  
- ✅ Fast response to change, continuous delivery, customer involvement  
- 🔄 **Result**: Agile became the dominant model because it’s built for uncertainty, iteration, and real-world feedback

## 🧪 Ugly Languages Can Be Great  
In software engineering, practicality beats purity. A language doesn’t need to be elegant — it needs to work.

**Lesson**: Use the language that solves the problem, integrates with your tools, and is supported by your environment. Beauty is optional — usefulness is not.

# 🐾 HW4 Example: Milestones in Action  
## Submission Deadline: November 7th, 2025

Even though the final deadline is November 7th, breaking the work into smaller milestones with planned dates are helping me stay on track and avoid last-minute stress.

# 🧪 "Ugly" Languages Used in HW4  
- **PHP**: Often criticized for its quirks, but it’s easy to deploy and works well for server-side scripting.  
- **SQL**: Verbose and rigid, but essential for defining and querying structured data in your database.  
- **JavaScript**: Messy at times, but it’s the backbone of interactive web interfaces and frontend logic.

These languages may not be beautiful, but they’re reliable and practical.
